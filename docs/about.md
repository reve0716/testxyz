# What is a Planet? (Testing Markdown)


## Just a few Planets
* [Mercury](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Mercury) :Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system - only slightly larger than the Earth's moon.
* [Venus](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Venus) :Venus is the second closest planet to the sun.
* [Earth](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Earth) :Earth is the third planet from the sun.

## Project layout
**_This is a test layout for markdown_.**

#### Planets
* The planet count in our solar system has gone as high as 15 before new discoveries prompted a fine tuning of the definition of a planet. The most recent change was in 2006 when scientists reclassified Pluto as a new kind of object - a dwarf plane.

#### Dwarf Planet
* This new class of worlds helps us categorize objects that orbit the Sun but aren't quite the same as the rocky planets and gas giants in our solar system. There could be hundreds more of these small worlds far out there waiting to be discovered.

#### Moons
* This count includes only the moons orbiting the eight planets in our solar system. It is likely there are more moons orbiting the giant planets of our solar system and there are moons orbiting around dwarf planets and asteroids.
