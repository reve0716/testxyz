## Test Project Layout
A solar system refers to a star and all the objects that travel in orbit around it. Our solar system consists of the _**sun**_ - our _**star**_ - **eight planets** and their **natural satellites** (such as our _**moon**_); __dwarf planets__; __asteroids__ and __comets__. Our solar system is located in an outward spiral of the *Milky Way galaxy*.
